replace Net::Cmd::getline via Net::SSLGlue::POP3 because it assumed, that it
just needs to wait for read events on the sockets - which is not the case for
SSL (e.g. SSL_WANT_READ, SSL_WANT_WRITE).

rewrite parts of Net::SSLGlue::LWP so that it sends the correct request
to the peer even if https_proxy is used. In former version it ommitted
the HTTP version number in the request (thus the request was invalid).
Bug report by PMOONEY https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=57365

document way to set different verification scheme for LWP

0.2 2009/01/02
https_proxy support for LWP, HTTPS_PROXY from Crypt::SSLeay did not work and
the https_proxy from LWP was broken with both Crypt::SSLeay and
IO::Socket::SSL (it did unencrypted https:// requests to the proxy).
Fix it so that it now does CONNECT (this is the meaning of https_proxy for
all other programs)
